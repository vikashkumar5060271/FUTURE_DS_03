🎓 Student Event Feedback Analysis
🔹 Project Overview

College events (tech fests, workshops, seminars, cultural activities) generate tons of student feedback. Instead of leaving responses unused, this project analyzes survey data to uncover student satisfaction trends, common complaints, and areas for improvement.

The project uses data cleaning, sentiment analysis, and visualization to transform raw survey feedback into actionable insights for event organizers.

🔹 Task

Collect student event feedback via Google Forms (CSV export).

Perform data cleaning & preprocessing (remove duplicates, handle missing values).

Apply sentiment analysis (TextBlob / VADER) to classify responses into Positive, Neutral, Negative.

Extract insights on:

Top-rated events

Average satisfaction score

Most common issues (word cloud/text analysis)

Correlation between rating and sentiment

Visualize results using seaborn/matplotlib charts.
